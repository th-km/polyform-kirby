  text: >
    We design custom typefaces, lettering,
    and logotypes with a special focus on
    Latin and Chinese scripts, covering
    languages across the Americas, Western
    and Central Europe, and China. Our
    approach connects the two cultures
    through design, history, and technology.
    Our expertise in both writing systems
    allows for a good dialogue between the
    two cultures, and enables us to design
    the best solution for each project.
